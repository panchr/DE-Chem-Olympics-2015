						<h2>Coal</h2>
						<p>Coal is composed primarily of carbon, but it also contains hydrogen, sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen.
						It is used as an energy source to produce electricity and heat. In fact, it is the largest source in generating electricity. It is also used for industrial purposes, such as refining metals.</p>
						<p>Coal can be extracted in numerous ways, depending on the location and source. For example, it is extracted through open-pit mining at the ground level, especially in the U.S. (in Wyoming). In addition, shaft mining is used when the coal source is underground. Since 1983, China has been the world's top coal producer. The U.S., India, and the European Union follow behind.</p>

						<h2>Oil</h2>
						<p>Similar to coal, oil is a hydrocarbon, so it has a high carbon and hydrogen content. In addition to being a liquid, it is slippery and flammable.
						Industrially, it is used to produce fuel, lubricants, paints, plastics, and numerous other materials.</p>
						<p>It can be found organically in plants and animals, which form it through metabolic processes. This form of oil formed contains lipids, proteins, waxes, and alkaloids.
						Its most-used industrial form is obtained near rocks and sands, and is often called its "mineral" form. However, this type is still formed organically, but is extracted as a fossil fuel.</p>
						<p>Oil can burned in liquid or aerosol form to generate light and heat, which can then be converted into electricity. Alternatively, crude oil is pumped from the ground and shipped to oil refineries to produce fuels, such as diesel, ethane, gasoline, and petroleum.</p>

						<h2>Natural Gas</h2>
						<p>Natural gas is formed from layers of buried plants, gases, and animals that are exposed to intense heat and pressure over thousands of years.
						The energy in natural gas comes from the chemical bonds stored in the decayed organic compounds.</p>
						<p>It can be created in one of two ways: biogenically from landfills and marshes or thermogenically from buried organic material.
						As a hydrocarbon, it is mostly made of methane, but can contain alkane, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and hydrogen sulfide.</p>
						<p>It is mostly used for heating, cooking, and generating electricity. In addition, it can be used as fuel for vehicles and in the manufacture of plastics.</p>

						<h4>Oil</h4>
						<p>At the end of 2012, there were 30.5 billion barrels of crude oil in reserves. There are also estimates that approximately 198 billion barrels remain undiscovered. However, 2012 also experienced the greatest production increase since 1859, with an additional 800,000 barrels produced.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>North Dakota and Montana have oil-bearing shales that contain kerogen, which is a precursor to oil</li>
							<li>The U.S. has the largest deposits of shale, even though it is not commerically converted to oil</li>
							<li>The Alaskan National Petroleum Reserve and the Bakken Formation</li>
							<li>Alaska OCS has approximately 38.8 billion barrels of crude oil.</li>
						</ul>

					<div id = "locations-gas">
						<h4>Natural Gas</h4>
						<p>Most of the world's natural gas reserves are in the Middle East, Europe, and the former U.S.S.R. The U.S. makes up about 4% but the undiscovered gases will allow the nation's supply to last for at least another 60 years.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Produced in 32 states</li>
							<li>Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Wyoming, and Louisana are the top producers</li>

				<h2>Extracting Fossil Fuels</h2>
				<p>The three resources can be extracted in numerous ways, the most common of which are listed below.</p>
			</header>
			<section id = "extraction-coal" class = "12u">
				<h3>Coal</h3>
				<p>Coal is mostly acquired in the U.S. through surface mining.</p>
				<ol class = "12u">
					<li>Bulldozers clear and level the mining area.</li>
					<li>Explosives are discharged to shatter the rock.</li>
					<li>The now-exposed coal is mined and shovelled</li>
					<li>Once collected, it is brought to a processing plant.</li>
				</ol>
			</section>
			<section id = "extraction-oil" class = "12u">
				<h3>Oil</h3>
				<p>Oil shares many of the extraction techniques with natural gas (which are described below), but with recovery techniques. Numerous recovery techniques are listed below.</p>
				<ul class = "12u">
					<li>Primary Recovery: pressure drives the oil upwards - this gets 10% of the oil</li>
					<li>Secondary Recovery: water is added to the reserve to separate the oil, due to polarity - this gets an additional 20%</li>
					<li>Enhanced Recovery: steam gas or water-soluble polymers are added to the mixture - another 30% extracted</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section id = "extraction-gas" class = "12u">
				<h3>Natural Gas</h3>
				<p>Natural gas mining occurs in a few subsequent processes, each with their own associated steps.</p>
				<div class = "row">
					<h4>Vertical Drilling</h4>
					<ol class = "12u">
						<li>Initiated by drilling straight down.</li>
						<li>The drill pipe is replaced with a steel pipe; this is called "surface casing".</li>
						<li>The surface casing is filled with cement, to create a solid wall between the freshwater and the drill.</li>
						<li>Once the drill reaches 5,000 to 10,000 feet, the horizontal drilling process starts.</li>
					</ol>
				</div>
				<div class = "row">
					<h4>Horizontal Drilling</h4>
					<ul class = "12u">
						<li>The start of horizontal drilling is when vertical drilling can't drill down anymore; this is the "kick-off point".</li>
						<li>Horizontal drilling occurs when the well starts to curve according to the shape of the earth.</li>
						<li>This creates many paths for one drill.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class = "row">
					<h4>Well Completion</h4>
					<ol class = "12u">
						<li>A perforating gun is lowered to the drilling spot of the rock.</li>
						<li>This gun creates holes in the rock to connect it to the wall.</li>
						<li>The tool is then removed.</li>
					</ol>
				</div>
				<div class = "row">
					<h4>Hydraulic Fracturing</h4>
					<ul class = "12u">
						<li>A mixture of sand and water acts as a lubricant.</li>
						<li>It also removes bacteria from the oil.</li>
						<li>The mining tools fracture the shale that contain oil and gas.</li>
					</ul>

			<h2>Converting to Usable Energy</h2>
			<p>Once extracted, the fossil fuels have to be converted to a usable form of energy, which is mostly electricity.</p>
			<p>All of the processes are very similar because they utilize combustion to convert chemical energy to heat, and then use a variety of transformations to create electricity.</p>
			<img src = "images/combustion-eq.png" class = "image fit half-max"/>
			<section id = "conversion-coal" class = "12u">
				<h3>Coal</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>Coal is ground into a fine powder to increase the surface area and thus, increase the rate of burning.</li>
					<li>The powder is mixed with hot air with a bellows to increase the burning efficiency.</li>
					<li>The mixture moves to the surface, where it is burned.</li>
					<li>The burning of coal creates steam from the water source, which is transferred to a turbine.</li>
					<li>The turbine turns, thus converting the kinetic energy of steam into mechanical energy, which spins the turbine engine.</li>
					<li>This powers the generator, which converts the mechanical energy to electrical energy. The generator creates electricity through rotation in a strong magnetic field of copper coils.</li>
					<li>The steam condenses and is released back into the boiler.</li>
					<li>The electricity is sent to a transformer to be distributed.</li>
				</ol>
				<img src = "images/converting-coal.png" class = "image fit half-max"/>
				<p>Newer processes for generating electricity from coal also exist, such as:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Fluidized Bed Conversion: burning coal by suspending it to react with air; this is cleaner by preventing the formation of nitrogen oxides, which can harm the environment.</li>
					<li>Combined-cycle systems produce gas by heating coal and then use the gas to power a gas-based generator that creates electricity.</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section id = "conversion-oil" class = "12u">
				<h3>Oil</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Oil is burned inside of a boiler which converts the chemical energy to heat energy, creating steam.</li>
					<li>The steam pressure powers a steam turbine, thus converting to mechanical energy.</li>
					<li>The turbine is connected to a generator, which spins and creates electrical energy.</li>
					<li>Once the steam contacts the cold pipes, it condenses into water to be reused.</li>
					<li>A transformer converts the electrical energy to high-voltage electricity to distribute around the power grid.</li>
					<li>Exhaust gases are released through an exhaust stack, which filter particles and most pollution from the gas.</li>

			</section>
			<section id = "conversion-gas" class = "12u">
				<h3>Natural Gas</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Natural gas is mixed with air and burned, creating heat energy. This also creates a few combustion gases that build up the pressure.</li>
					<li>The pressure drives the turbine, which powers the generator, creating electrical energy.</li>
					<li>The hot combustion gas is piped to a heat recovery steam generator, which heats water to create steam.</li>
					<li>The steam powers the turbine and generator more, thus creating even more electricity.</li>
					<li>When the steam reaches the cold pipes, it cools down to water once more.</li>
					<li>The electricity is distributed and the combustion gas is cleansed through a stack and then released.</li>

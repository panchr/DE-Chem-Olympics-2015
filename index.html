							<h2>Coal</h2>
							<p>Coal is composed primarily of carbon, but it also contains hydrogen, sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen.
							It is used as an energy source to produce electricity and heat. In fact, it is the largest source in generating electricity. It is also used for industrial purposes, such as refining metals.</p>
							<p>Coal can be extracted in numerous ways, depending on the location and source. For example, it is extracted through open-pit mining at the ground level, especially in the U.S. (in Wyoming). In addition, shaft mining is used when the coal source is underground. Since 1983, China has been the world's top coal producer. The U.S., India, and the European Union follow behind.</p>

							<h2>Oil</h2>
							<p>Similar to coal, oil is a hydrocarbon, so it has a high carbon and hydrogen content. In addition to being a liquid, it is slippery and flammable.
							Industrially, it is used to produce fuel, lubricants, paints, plastics, and numerous other materials.</p>
							<p>It can be found organically in plants and animals, which form it through metabolic processes. This form of oil formed contains lipids, proteins, waxes, and alkaloids.
							Its most-used industrial form is obtained near rocks and sands, and is often called its "mineral" form. However, this type is still formed organically, but is extracted as a fossil fuel.</p>
							<p>Oil can burned in liquid or aerosol form to generate light and heat, which can then be converted into electricity. Alternatively, crude oil is pumped from the ground and shipped to oil refineries to produce fuels, such as diesel, ethane, gasoline, and petroleum.</p>

							<h2>Natural Gas</h2>
							<p>Natural gas is formed from layers of buried plants, gases, and animals that are exposed to intense heat and pressure over thousands of years.
							The energy in natural gas comes from the chemical bonds stored in the decayed organic compounds.</p>
							<p>It can be created in one of two ways: biogenically from landfills and marshes or thermogenically from buried organic material.
							As a hydrocarbon, it is mostly made of methane, but can contain alkane, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and hydrogen sulfide.</p>
							<p>It is mostly used for heating, cooking, and generating electricity. In addition, it can be used as fuel for vehicles and in the manufacture of plastics.</p>
